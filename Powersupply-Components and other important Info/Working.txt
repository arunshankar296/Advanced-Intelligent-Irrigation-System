The Advanced Intelligent Irrigation System is built to automate irrigation using real-time sensor data and time-based scheduling.
The system is powered by the Arduino Mega 2560, which receives inputs from various sensors.
Soil moisture sensors monitor the moisture content of the soil.
An ultrasonic sensor is used to measure the water level in the storage tank.
A well water level sensor checks the availability of water in the well before pumping.
The DS3231 RTC module ensures accurate timing for scheduled irrigation activities.
A mains power detection circuit monitors the availability of electricity for safe pump operation.
A current sensor tracks whether the pump is running and monitors power consumption.
Flow sensors on two irrigation lines measure water delivery to ensure efficient usage.
Based on sensor data and time conditions, the Arduino controls relays to switch the pump and solenoid valves (drip lines) on or off.
A 20x4 I2C LCD displays real-time data such as soil moisture levels, tank water level, pump status
The system logic is implemented using the Arduino IDE, resulting in a smart, automated, and sustainable irrigation system with minimal manual effort.
